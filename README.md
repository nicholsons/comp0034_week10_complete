# COMP0034 Week 10

This contains a completed example of the activities from week 10.

It is a very simple example of a REST API. If you plan to develop REST APIs beyond this course then I recommend that you
review some of the Flask and Python libraries that support this, as well as improving the authentication used.

It is not intended as an exemplar and there may be errors!
